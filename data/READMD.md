You might notice two directories are currently missing here: music and sfx.

The sound and music in Abuse was done by Bobby Prince but not released into the
public domain along with the rest of the Abuse art and data. Apparently he's OK
with them being copied as long as they aren't modified.

I'm not sure if GitHub is OK with that policy, though, so for the sake of the
GitHub repository these files are simply left out.

You can get them from [Zoy's Abuse page](http://abuse.zoy.org/wiki/download).

Copy those directories into this directory and they will be automatically
included.
