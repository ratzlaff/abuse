Requirements for compiling
==========================

- SDL 1.1.6 or higher <http://www.libsdl.org> (note that SDL2 will not work)
- [SDL_mixer 1.2](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release-1.2.html)
- [CMake 2.8.9 or later](http://www.cmake.org/)
- GL libraries and headers are required for OpenGL support.

Compiling
---------

1. Clone this repository.

       git clone https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse.git

2. Create a new directory for the build. CMake likes to build into directories
   outside the source directory and its best not to fight it on this.

   Within that directory, run CMake.

   In order to get a build that includes all the data, you'll want to specify
   an install directory. All told, you might setup doing something like:

       mkdir abuse
       cd abuse
       git clone https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse.git
       mkdir build
       cd build
       cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=../final-binary ../abuse

   Under Windows, this will probably fail because it can't find the SDL or
   SDL_mixer libraries. Two solutions to this:

      1. Run `cmake-gui` and provide the paths that way
      2. Set `SDLDIR` and `SDLMIXERDIR` to point to where you extracted the
         Windows VC devel binaries for each library

3. Build the files

   Under Linux and Mac OS X, this is the familiar `make`.

   Under Windows, you'll want to use `MSBuild abuse.sln`.

4. Build the install.

   Under Linux and Mac OS X, this is the familiar `make install`.

   Under Windows, it's `MSBuild INSTALL.vcxproj`.
